<main><h1>Variable Refresh Rate</h1>
<p>FS-UAE can be used with variable refresh rate hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>nVIDIA G-SYNC / G-SYNC Compatible</li>
<li>AMD FreeSync (VESA Adaptive-Sync)</li>
</ul>
<p>This allows for smooth and even rendering of the Amiga display, similar to
classic v-sync, but with lower latency, and without the occasional hiccups due
to missing a frame.</p>
<p>If you can afford it, I highly recommend getting a setup with G-SYNC or
FreeSync for FS-UAE (and other emulators). This is definitively the best way to
experience FS-UAE.</p>
<h2>Desktop refresh rate setting</h2>
<p>Due to the way variable refresh rate work and based on experience, you get most
reliable results when your desktop refresh rate is <em>higher</em> than the refresh
rate of the emulated system.</p>
<p>So for example, if you want to emulate both 50/60 Hz systems, your desktop
refresh rate should be <em>more</em> than 60 Hz, for example 85 Hz. But you can also
just go as high as your monitor allows, for example 144 Hz. The important thing
is to use &gt; 60 Hz (or &gt; 50 Hz if you only want to emulate PAL systems).</p>
<p>Note, when you want to visually verify that G-SYNC / FreeSync is working (see
the next section), any stuttering due to it <em>not working</em> will be more obvious
with a lower refresh rate, so 85 Hz is a quite good one for this purpose.</p>
<h2>Visually verifying that G-SYNC / FreeSync is working</h2>
<p>The best way to see if G-SYNC / FreeSync is actually working is to use your
eyes. Start the emulator with a game / program which scrolls with constant
speed. For example:</p>
<pre><code>War Zone (1991)(Core)[cr Flashtro][t +26 Flashtro]
</code></pre>
<p>This cracktro has a horizontally scrolling text with fixed speed. If you run in
windowed mode, you should see micro-stuttering (uneven movement of the
scrolling text). When you change to fullscreen, if G-SYNC / FreeSync is working
properly, the scrolling should be perfectly smooth in comparison.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>In general, variable refresh rate will only work in fullscreen (when FS-UAE
covers the entire X display). This means that you must likely only have one
monitor enabled in a multi-monitor setup, and you cannot have any overlapping
windows (for example, desktop notifications appearing will temporarily disable
variable refresh rate).</p>
<h2>nVIDIA G-Sync on Linux</h2>
<p>Use NVIDIA X Server Settings to enable "Allow G-SYNC/G-SYNC Compatible" under
OpenGL Settings.</p>
<p>To verify that G-SYNC is working/enabled, you can also enable "Enable
G-SYNC/G-SYNC Compatible Visual Indicator" which adds a green G-SYNC logo in
the upper right corner of the screen when FS-UAE is running and G-SYNC is
active.</p>
<p>Please note that G-SYNC will only work (at the time of this writing) of you
have a single monitor enabled. If you have more than one monitor, disconnect
the other one(s) before running FS-UAE. Just disabling the other monitors
should also work, but the author has experienced stuttering every few seconds
when other monitors are connected, even if they are disabled.</p>
<h3>AMD FreeSync on Linux</h3>
<p>Please make sure you have Linux kernel 5.0 and greater. You need to modify your
Xorg configuration to enable freesync. Create a file called
<code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-amdgpu-variable-refresh.conf</code> (create
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ if needed) with the content:</p>
<pre><code>Section "Device"
    Identifier "AMD"
    Driver "amdgpu"
    Option "DRI" "3"
    Option "VariableRefresh" "true"
EndSection
</code></pre>
<p>To verify that variable refresh rate is enabled, you can check the output of
<code>xrandr --prop</code>, you should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>...
DisplayPort-1 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 [...]
...
        vrr_capable: 1
                range: (0, 1)
</code></pre>
<p>If your connected display supports FreeSync, you should see vrr_capable: 1.</p>
<p>Additionally, to check that variable refresh rate is enabled in the driver, you
can check for the following line in \$HOME/.local/share/xorg/Xorg.0.log:</p>
<pre><code>AMDGPU(0): VariableRefresh: enabled
</code></pre>
<h1>macOS</h1>
<p>At the time of writing, the author is not aware of support for variable refresh
rate in macOS.</p></main>
