<p>When you emulate an Amiga joystick with your keyboard, the following keys are
used to control the joystick:</p>
<pre><code>Cursor keys controls the joystick stick.
Right Ctrl or Right Alt controls the fire button.
</code></pre>
<p>When the keys are used to emulate the joystick, they will not activate the
corresponding Amiga keys while you use this feature. So to use all Amiga
features at the same time, a connected real joystick or gamepad is recommended,
though it is usually not a problem. Most joystick-controlled games do not
require the keyboard cursor keys to be used also…</p>
<p>When playing CD32 games with the keyboard emulating a gamepad, additional keys
are used to control the addition buttons on the gamepad:</p>
<pre><code>Cursor Keys – Controls the directional pad.
C – Red
X – Blue
D – Green
S – Yellow
Return – Play
Z – Rewind
A – Forward
Right Ctrl or Right Alt also controls the red button.
</code></pre>

<h2>Disabling the keyboard joystick device</h2>
<p>To disable the built-in joystick keyboard emulation, make sure the following
(empty) file exists: <code>FS-UAE/Data/Devs/Keyboard.fs-device-disabled</code>. You might
want to do this if you create other custom joystick keyboard emulation such as
