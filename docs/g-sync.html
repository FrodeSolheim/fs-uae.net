<main><h1>G-Sync</h1>
<p>FIXME:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Important to set desktop refresh rate above the emulation rate? I.e. for PAL,
  use at least 60 Hz desktop refresh rate, and at least 85 Hz for NTSC? To
  avoid g-sync driver throttling the speed? (Seems to be imported for Nvidia on
  Linux at least)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having extra monitors connected is problematic. More than one monitor
  disables G-Sync (on Linux). Disabling the monitor temporarily in Nvidia
  settings causes occasional stuttering - also in window mode when G-Sync is
  not active (some polling of the disabled display by the Nvidia driver
  interfering with the output??)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tip: Enable visual indicators and ensure that the indicators says G-SYNC in
  green and FLIP in green (not BLIT in red).</p>
</li>
</ul></main>
