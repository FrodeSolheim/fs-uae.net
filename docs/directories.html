<main><h1>Paths and directories</h1>
<p>By default, FS-UAE creates a number of directories in <code>Documents/FS-UAE</code> to
store the files used by FS-UAE: CD-ROMs, Configurations, Controllers, Flash
Memory, Floppies, Floppy Overlays, Hard Drives, Kickstarts, Logs, Save States.</p>
<p>In addition, if you use FS-UAE Launcher, it will create some directories of its
own. The following directories can be used by FS-UAE and/or the Launcher if
found in Documents/FS-UAE: <code>Covers</code>, <code>Screenshots</code>, <code>Titles</code>, <code>Themes</code>.</p>
<p>See "Specifying Paths in Configuration Files" in Configuration Files instead if
you are looking for information about the different ways of referring to
directories and files in FS-UAE.</p>
<h2>Base directory</h2>
<p>By default, FS-UAE creates its directories under <code>Documents/FS-UAE</code>. For Linux
users: If your Documents directory is not configured according to the XDG user
dir spec, <code>$HOME/FS-UAE</code> will be used as a fallback.</p>
<p>From FS-UAE 3.1.57 and onwards, <code>$HOME/FS-UAE</code> will automatically be used if it
exists.</p>
<p>You can override this by putting the path to the desired base directory in a
special config file. The config file will be read by both FS-UAE and FS-UAE
Launcher if it exists:</p>
<pre><code>Windows: &lt;LOCALAPPDATA&gt;/FS-UAE/base-dir
OS X: ~/Library/Preferences/fs-uae/base-dir
Linux/other: ~/.config/fs-uae/base-dir
</code></pre>
<p>This file must be a simple text file with (only) the full path to the desired
base directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For windows users, the most common location of this config file
<code>C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\FS-UAE\base-dir</code>. Also make sure that when
you create this file, that it isn't created as base-dir.txt (which won't)
work - a common problem if you use Notepad or similar. It is a good idea to,
temporarily or permanently, change Explorer settings to show file extension
for all files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, you can starting FS-UAE and/or FS-UAE Launcher with
<code>--base-dir=/path/to/desired/dir</code>.</p>
<p>A final option to avoid all this is to simply use the
<a href="portable">portable version</a> of FS-UAE. With a portable setup, both the
application and data files are placed together in the same directory, and you
can move this directory around at will, even between computers.</p>
<h2>Media directories</h2>
<p>The following directories are created as default locations to hold your Amiga
media:</p>
<ul>
<li>CD-ROMs</li>
<li>Floppies</li>
<li>Hard Drives</li>
</ul>
<p>The location and names of these directories can be overridden with the
following options in config files: cdroms_dir, floppies_dir, hard_drives_dir.</p>
<p>You do not have to store your Amiga files here, but when media are located in
one of these directories (or a sub-directory), you can refer to contained files
without using full paths. For example a floppy image file called Lotus2.adf
stored in the Floppies directory can be inserted into the first floppy drive
with this option:</p>
<pre><code>floppy_drive_0 = Lotus2.adf
</code></pre>
<p>If the file is located outside the Floppies directory, you must instead use an
absolute path or one of the other ways to specify paths.</p>
<h2>Referring to directories</h2>
<p>Paths in configuration files can be specified as either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relative paths</li>
<li>Absolute paths</li>
<li>Paths beginning with special variables</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On Windows, you must either use forward slashes in paths in
configuration files, or you must use double backslashes. Example:
<code>C:/Amiga/Files</code> and <code>C:\\Amiga\\Files</code> are both correct, but
<code>C:\Amiga\Files</code> is not!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relative paths will be looked up relative to either the current directory, or
(more often) relative to a relevant default directory. For example, relative
floppy image paths will be looked up relative to the Floppies directory.</p>
<p>Absolute paths are paths beginning with a drive letter (Windows), or a slash
(Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD).</p>
<p>To avoid having to use absolute paths, and to make configuration files more
portable, you can prefix paths with some special variables (Note: these are not
environment variables, though $HOME looks like one):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$CONFIG</code> – The directory containing the loaded configuration file.</li>
<li><code>$APP</code> – On Mac OS X, the directory containing the currently running
  FS-UAE.app, on other platforms, it is he same as $EXE. This means that $APP
  should normally be preferred over EXE for portability.</li>
<li><code>$EXE</code> – The directory containing the currently running FS-UAE executable.</li>
<li><code>$HOME</code> – The user's home directory.</li>
<li><code>$DOCUMENTS</code> – The user’s documents directory.</li>
<li><code>$BASE</code> – The FS-UAE base directory, usually Documents/FS-UAE, or the root of
  the portable directory if using the portable version.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FIXME</strong>: CONFIG, APP, EXE should perhaps be renamed to CONFIGDIR, APPDIR,
EXEDIR instead. Also, is EXE/EXEDIR really needed? Path to the exe inside the
app bundle isn't often useful (only in same cases with bundled configs)
inside the app, so maybe make a special name for that instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take note that if you are specifying these prefixes as command line arguments,
you must take care to avoid the shell replacing them with environment
variables. Either escape the <code>$</code> with <code>\$</code> or use single quotes around the path
to prevent environment variable expansion.</p>
<h2>Covers, screenshots and titles for FS-UAE Launcher</h2>
<p>See the FS-UAE Launcher page for information about the structure of the
following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Covers (front covers of game boxes)</li>
<li>Screenshots</li>
<li>Titles (Screenshot of the game title screen)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Paths for covers (etc) are subject to change for FS-UAE Launcher
4.0.</p>
