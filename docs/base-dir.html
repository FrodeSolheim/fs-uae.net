<main><h1>Base directory</h1>
<p>The so-called base directory is the place where FS-UAE stores its files. By
default, this location is <code>Documents/FS-UAE</code> or <code>$HOME/FS-UAE</code> depending on the
FS-UAE version and your system. It it possible to change this location to
something else.</p>
<p>See [directories.md] for more information.</p>
<p>If you use the portable version, the base directory is the same as the portable
directory (the directory containing Portable.ini).</p></main>
