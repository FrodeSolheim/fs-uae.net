<h1>Option: mouse_integration</h1>
<pre>
AKA magic mouse / mousehack / virtual mouse driver
This option implies (unless overriden):
- cursor = 0
- automatic-input-grab = 0
FIXME: On OS X, cursor movement is currently not received by FS-UAE when
the window is not focused (either something SDL 2 or OS X itself does).
This makes mouse integration on OS X a bit less useful at the moment.
