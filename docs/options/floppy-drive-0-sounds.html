<h1>Option: floppy_drive_0_sounds</h1>
<pre>
Example: A500Real
Default:
Since: 2.1.17
Specify the name of an alternative floppy drive sound set, such as
* A500
* A500Real
* ST
* LOUD
You need to provide these files yourself and put them into
Documents/FS-UAE/Floppy Sounds/. A zip file with the drive sounds can be
downloaded from www.winuae.net (Download section).
The default is to use the included drive sounds. You can also use this
option to turn off floppy drive sounds for this drive by setting the value
to &quot;off&quot;.
Remember that this option applies to a single floppy drive. You may want to
set the same value for all floppy drives.
