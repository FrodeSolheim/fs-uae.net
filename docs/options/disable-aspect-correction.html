<h1>Option: disable_aspect_correction</h1>
<pre>
Example: 1
Since: 1.3.8
With some themes with overlays and/or specific scaling options (or
explicitly configured viewport), you may want to set the following option
to disable the keep_aspect option (it will have no effect and aspect
ratio correction is always off).
