<h1>Option: uae_sound_output</h1>
<pre>
Category: Hardware
Default:
Description: Sound emulation
Example: interrupts
Allows you to choose whether sound is emulated or not. Valid values are:
Value: none (Disabled)
Value: interrupts (Emulated, No Output)
Value: exact (Enabled)
FIXME: check with WinUAE/Toni. In the WinUAE GUI there is only GUI selectors
for &quot;none&quot;, &quot;interrupts&quot; and &quot;exact&quot; (or so it seems), but code in cfgfile.cpp
still automatically enables &quot;normal&quot; for many quickstart configurations...
EDIT: As far as I can see, the UAE code does not really distinguish between
2 (normal) and 3 (exact), except for one place (in uaelib.cpp):
if (!sound_available || currprefs.produce_sound == 2)
# Allows you to select the accuracy of the emulated sound. The default value
# depends on the accuracy option. Valid values are:
#
# Value: none (Disabled)
# Value: interrupts (No sound output)
# Value: normal (Normal)
# Value: exact (Exact)
