<h1>Option: viewport</h1>

Example: 74 * 640 400 =&gt; * 20 * *
The option viewport specifies a crop rectangle to apply to the Amiga
video-out. The default, if not specified, is to calculate this automatically
(auto-scaling). To force an uncropped viewport (and effectively disable
autoscaling), you can specify:
  viewport = * * * * =&gt; 0 0 752 574
If auto-scaling does not work perfectly for a game, and you want a cropped
output, you can specify any crop rectangle (x y width height), The following
viewport is appropriate for many games:
  viewport = * * * * =&gt; 74 36 640 400
Often, Amiga games have viewports with varying size and position. The default
auto-scaling system works well with many games, but not all. You can modify
the auto-scaling algorithm by specifying patterns to replace. The viewport
setting will be consulted each time the auto-scaling algorithm chooses a
new viewport.
Here are some examples:
The following viewport pattern will match if the auto-scaling algorithm
thinks the viewport should be 640Ã—400 and start at 74 from the left. The
top can be anything (*). Now, the top parameter will be forced to 20.
A * on the right side of =&gt; means to keep the existing value, while
a * on the left side means to match any value.
  viewport = 74 * 640 400 =&gt; * 20 * *
The following viewport specification does nothing:
  * * * * =&gt; * * * *
This following viewport is a simple translation
(74 40 640 400 =&gt; * 36 * * would behave the same):
  74 40 640 400 =&gt; 74 36 640 400
You can specify more than one pattern by separating them with commas.
In this case, the first matching pattern will be used. Here is a viewport
specification which works perfectly with Pinball Dreams: (this basically
says: keep the viewport 74 28 640 524 as it is, and all other viewports
will be forced to 74 36 640 512.
  viewport = 74 28 640 524 =&gt; * * * *, * * * * =&gt; 74 36 640 512
This one is great for Turrican II:
  viewport = 74 * 640 384 =&gt; 74 36 640 424
But rembember, many games work perfectly with the builtin viewport detection,
and if you do not want auto-scaling, you can disable it by specifying a fixed
viewport of your choice.
