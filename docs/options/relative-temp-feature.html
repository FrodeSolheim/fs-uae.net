<h1>Option: relative_temp_feature</h1>
<pre>
Description: Relative Temporary Directories
Type: Boolean
Default: 0
Example: 1
Use this option to force FS-UAE Launcher to create a config where FS-UAE
refers to media via relative directories. This allows save states to be
used with directory hard drives (but still not completely safely).
