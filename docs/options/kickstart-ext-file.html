<h1>Option: kickstart_ext_file</h1>
<pre>
Example: path/to/extended-kickstart.rom
The path to the extended kickstart ROM (for CD32 or AROS). If the ROM
file is located in the standard kickstarts dir, it can be referenced
by name only, no directory component is needed.
Code:
    if c.kickstart_file.explicit:
        value = c.kickstart_file.explicit
    else:
        value = &quot;&quot;
</pre>
</main>
