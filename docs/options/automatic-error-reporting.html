Summary: Automatic error reports
Tags: fsapp
Type: Boolean
Default: 0
Example: 1
Turned off by default as a privacy measure. It is recommended to turn this on
to allow the developers go get useful information about bugs and data to help
determine which problems should be prioritized.
This option applies to the Launcher only. FS-UAE can not send automatic error
reports at this time.
The automatic error reports will be sent to the sentry.io service, and will
only be made available for core FS-UAE developers.
The automatically generated error reports will only be used to help find and
fix bugs, and the data will never be used for any other purpose.
