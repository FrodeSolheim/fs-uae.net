<h1>Option: floppies_dir</h1>
<pre>
Default: [base_dir]/Floppies
Search for (relative) floppy image paths relative to this dir (in addition
to current directory).
This means that if you have a floppy image &quot;Test.adf&quot; in the Floppies
directory, you can for example simply set [floppy_drive_0] = Test.adf (without
including the directory path).
