<h1>Option: offline_mode</h1>
<pre>
Summary: Offline mode
Type: Boolean
Default: 0
Example: 1
When in offline mode, the Launcher will not try to download files from
the Internet. This option might be most useful for testing, since the
Launcher will prefer local files anyway.
Not all parts of the program supports offline mode.
