<h1>Option: video_format</h1>
<pre>
Description: &quot;Video buffer format and color depth&quot;
Default: bgra
Example: rgb565
Since: 1.1.4
Type: choice
This option allows you to configure whether video data is stored in RGBA or
BGRA byte order in the internal video buffers. This setting (together with
texture_format) may affect texture upload performance. The option should not
be shared between computers, since appropriate values may differ for other
operating system or OpenGL GPU vendors. Valid values are:
Value: bgra (&quot;32-bit BGRA&quot;)
       This is the default setting as it has been verified to provide
       best 32-bit color performance with most OpenGL drivers.
Value: rgba (&quot;32-bit RGBA&quot;)
       Depending on your system, this may give better 32-bit performance.
Value: rgb565 (&quot;16-bit&quot;)
       Using this format means that less data needs to be uploaded to the
       GPU. May be quite a bit faster on slower systems.
