<h1>Option: video_sync</h1>
<pre>
Alias: vsync, sync
Default: 0
Description: &quot;Video synchronization&quot;
Example: 1
Type: choice
Video sync behaviour can be configured with the &quot;video_sync&quot; option. The
default setting is off. The available values are:
Value: 1 (&quot;Auto&quot;)
       If the host refresh rate matches the game&#x27;s refresh rate, emulation
       and video will be synchronized to the display for perfectly smooth
       scrolling. If not, FS-UAE will only sync buffer swap to vblank in order
       to remove tearing.
# Value: vblank (&quot;Buffer swap only&quot;)
#        Video buffer swap (but not emulation) will be synced to vblank
#        to remove tearing. This value is used to prevent FS-UAE from
#        synchronizing the emulation to the display.
Value: 0 (&quot;Off&quot;)
       Video and emulation will not be synced to the display. Instead,
       a timer will be used to manage the emulation speed. You may see
       tearing on the display since buffer swaps are not synchronized to
       vblank either.
The previous value &quot;full&quot; is deprecated as of FS-UAE version 2.2.2, and it
will now behave as auto. See [assume_refresh_rate] if you need to force vsync.
