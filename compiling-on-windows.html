		<p>These instructions are very much step-by-step, and almost anyone should be able to follow these steps. You still need to able to think a bit for yourself, for example, I won&#8217;t tell you to press <code>Y</code> if some of the commands asks you to confirm by pressing <code>Y</code> ðŸ™‚ -And I also assume you understand that you need to press Return after having typed (or even better, copied + pasted) a command.</p>
<h2>Preparing the MSYS2 Build Environment</h2>
<p>Download MSYS2 installer from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/x86_64/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/x86_64/</a> (at the time of writing, the correct file was called <code>msys2-x86_64-20141113.exe</code>. If there&#8217;s a similar one but with a newer date, pick that one instead).</p>
<p class="info">If you have a 32-bit Windows, you can use <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/files/Base/i686/">this MSYS2 version</a> instead, but the rest of the document assumes you picked the x86_64 one. Note, this is <strong>completely unrelated</strong> to if FS-UAE should be compiled for 32-bit or 64-bit, so pick the x86_64 version if you have 64-bit Windows, even if you want to compile 32-bit FS-UAE.</p>
<p>After downloading <code>msys2-x86_64-XXXXXXXX.exe</code>, double-click to install it, and just go with the default options. The <code>MSYS2 Shell</code> should be started automatically when installation is completed (provided you didn&#8217;t change any options).</p>
<p>Run the following command in <code>MSYS2 Shell</code> to update the package database:</p>
<pre>pacman -Sy</pre>
<p>And then, to ensure the base runtime is updated:</p>
<pre>pacman --needed -S bash pacman msys2-runtime</pre>
<p>Now, it is <strong>important</strong> to close <code>MSYS2 Shell</code>. After you have done this, you can start a <strong>new</strong> <code>MSYS2 Shell</code> from the Windows start menu!.</p>
<p>Now, you can update all other installed packages:</p>
<pre>pacman -Su</pre>
<p>Now, we need to install some tools which are either required during the build process, or is useful to have:</p>
<pre>pacman -S autoconf automake gettext git libtool make pkg-config zip unzip nano patch wget dos2unix</pre>
<p>Finally, you can close <code>MSYS2 Shell</code> and move on to the next section ðŸ™‚</p>
<h2>Installing Inno Setup</h2>
<p>In order to create the installers, you need to download and install inno setup: <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is-unicode.exe">http://www.jrsoftware.org/download.php/is-unicode.exe</a> (direct link to executable installer). Important: Install to the default location, so the build scripts can find it. You can also use the other default values, and you don&#8217;t need to run the program at the end of the installation.</p>
<p>You can skip this step if you&#8217;re not going to build distributions of FS-UAE.</p>
<h2>Building a Development Version (32-bit) from Git</h2>
<p>First, start a new <code>MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell</code> (it&#8217;s important to start the <strong>Win32</strong> one). Install the required development libraries with:</p>
<pre>pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-i686-openal mingw-w64-i686-glew mingw-w64-i686-SDL2 mingw-w64-i686-python3 mingw-w64-i686-python3-pyqt5 mingw-w64-i686-python3-setuptools mingw-w64-i686-python2 mingw-w64-i686-python3-lhafile mingw-w64-i686-python3-cx_Freeze mingw-w64-i686-libmpeg2</pre>
<p>Check out the source code for FS-UAE:</p>
<pre>cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/FrodeSolheim/fs-uae.git</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll now have a <strong>fs-uae</strong> directory. You can enter it, and compile FS-UAE with the following commands one by one (you&#8217;ll get a lot of text output after most of the commands):</p>
<pre>cd $HOME/fs-uae
./bootstrap
./configure
make clean all
</pre>
<p>If the commands succeeded, you should now have a <code>fs-uae.exe</code> binary, and you can start it without installing it by running:</p>
<pre>./fs-uae</pre>
<p>Go back to the home directory and check out the source code for FS-UAE Launcher:</p>
<pre>cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/FrodeSolheim/fs-uae-launcher.git</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s all there is to it, you should now be able to run FS-UAE Launcher like this:</p>
<pre>./fs-uae-launcher</pre>
<p>When you run <code>fs-uae-launcher.exe</code> like this, it will automatically find the compiled <code>fs-uae.exe</code> from the sibling directory.</p>
<h2>Creating the Installer</h2>
<p class="info">The scripts for assembling the FS-UAE suite installer are not yet available in the source archives.</p>
<h2>Building a 64-bit Version</h2>
<p>The instructions for building a 64-bit (x86_64) version of FS-UAE is the same as for 32-bit (i686), except that instead of running <code>MinGW-w64 Win32 Shell</code>, you need to run <code>MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell</code>. You also need to install the 64-bit version of the required libraries:</p>
<pre>pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-openal mingw-w64-x86_64-glew mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-pyqt5 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-setuptools mingw-w64-x86_64-python2 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-lhafile mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-cx_Freeze mingw-w64-x86_64-libmpeg2</pre>
