<p>FS-UAE Launcher currently supports using a game database to automatically find games you have by scanning your directories for known disk images and/or WHDLoad games, but it is currently a bit difficult for people to contribute to this database -this needs to be much easier!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=66335">You should vote here</a> if you would like to see this feature developed further -or if you think this is a waste of time!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Current features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan a list of directories and look for known files</li>
<li>Â Found games are automatically added to the game list in the launcher.</li>
<li>Show cover, title and screenshots for known games.</li>
<li>Floppy-based games in ADF and IPF format are supported</li>
<li>Files are identified and found by checksum, not name, so you organize your files as you see fit, and don&#8217;t need to constantly rename files according to DAT files or similar.</li>
<li>WHDLoad games are supported -WHDLoad games can be zipped or unzipped, the launcher can find the individual files on disk (or in archives) and re-assemble the WHDLoad game on launch.</li>
<li>Files inside zip archives are also indexes, and are temporarily extracted on demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thousands of game entries have been automatically created by an algorithm looking at (among other sources) the TOSEC dat files to get a starting point. But of course, not all these configurations work out of the box. Special configuration may be needed. So to get a quality database, humans must test and improve the entries.</p>
<p>I propose a system where the launcher automatically synchronizes game entries from a central server, and where anyone can make modifications to game entries in the FS-UAE Launcher GUI, register an account on the server, and have FS-UAE Launcher submit the fixes to the central server so everyone will benefit from the improvements. This includes specifying custom configuration (if needed) and submitting images.</p>
<ul>
<li>The central server will keep history for all changes, so changes can be easily reverted.</li>
<li>The list of changes will be used to download incremental updates to the database.</li>
<li>It will be possible to have local overrides for specific configuration values and/or images.</li>
<li>Images can be downloaded on demand (and cached), so the launcher does not need to download a huge data set to get started.</li>
<li>This is mainly a configuration database, and it is not intenteded to compete with Hall Of Light or Lemon Amiga for collecting detailed metadata. A minimal set of metadata (year, publisher, etc) is of course relevant, but for extended information, links til HOL/LemonAmiga will be associated with entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The database includes many variations of the same games (for instance multiple cracked versions from the TOSEC set). I propose some kind of voting/rating/like system, so only the most popular variants are showed in the launcher by default if you have many variants available (configurable by the user, of course).</p>
<p>The license for the database should be a quite liberal license (a Creative Commons variant?) to allow other projects to use the information as well. It does not make sense (IMO) to build such a database and then try to limit the usability.</p>
<p>It only makes sense to build infrastructure for this if people are interested in contributing.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=66335">You should vote</a> if you would like to see this feature developed</strong> (and also perhaps subscribe to the thread if you want to follow the discussion)</p>
