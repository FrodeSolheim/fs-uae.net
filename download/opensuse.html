<h2>openSUSE</h2>
<p>
  To get the latest version,
  <b
    >first visit my
    <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3AFrodeSolheim&package=fs-uae">openSUSE package repository</a>
    and add it to your system</b
  >
  using the commands listed there. If you skip this step you may get an outdated version from your openSUSE distribution. Then, to install FS-UAE as well as the Launcher and the Arcade frontends:
</p>
<!-- FIXME: Not sure if kernel-modules-extra must be manually installed anymore -->
<pre>sudo zypper install fs-uae fs-uae-launcher fs-uae-arcade</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you can download the generic <a href="/download/linux/">Linux version</a> which should work on most recent Linux distributions.</p>
