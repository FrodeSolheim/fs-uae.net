A game pad or joystick is recommended, but not required (FS-UAE can emulate a joystick using the cursor keys and right ctrl\/alt keys).<\/p>\n<h2>Accurate Emulation<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE integrates the most accurate Amiga emulation code available from the WinUAE project.<\/p>\n<h2>On-Screen GUI With Joystick Control<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_582\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/lemmings_menu.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-582\" class=\" wp-image-582 \" title=\"Lemmings Menu\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/02\/lemmings_menu-300x168.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-582\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Opened the on-screen menu while playing Lemmings<\/p><\/div>\n<p>FS-UAE is fully controllable with a gamepad, with an on-screen GUI, which means that you can easily swap floppies and load save states with your gamepad. In addition to being great on your personal computer, FS-UAE is also well suited to be started from an emulator frontend running on a HTPC.<\/p>\n<p>The screenshot shows the on-screen GUI. From here, you can (among other things) change input options and insert floppy images. The 3D effect is only active while in menu mode, of course.When playing the game, the game occupies the entire window.<\/p>\n<h2>Configuration GUI<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_2180\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Launcher.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2180\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2180\" title=\"FS-UAE Launcher running in GNOME 3 on Linux\" alt=\"\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Launcher-300x172.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"172\" srcset=\"https:\/\/fs-uae.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Launcher-300x172.png 300w, https:\/\/fs-uae.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Launcher-1024x589.png 1024w, https:\/\/fs-uae.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Launcher-500x287.png 500w, https:\/\/fs-uae.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/11\/Launcher.png 1236w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2180\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">FS-UAE Launcher running in GNOME 3 on Linux<\/p><\/div>\n<p>FS-UAE includes an easy-to-use graphical configuration program which allows you to enjoy FS-UAE and Amiga emulation without writing configuration files. Using this program is optional, and if you are a minimalist, you can instead use just FS-UAE alone.<\/p>\n<h2>Good Joystick and Gamepad Support<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE recognizes and supports many joysticks and gamepads out of the box without any configuration, with correct setup both for Amiga and CD32. Support for additional models can be configured with the joystick configuration tool bundled with FS-UAE Launcher.<\/p>\n<h2>Video Synchronization<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE can synchronize to your 50 Hz monitor (for PAL Amiga emulation) or 60 Hz monitor (for NTSC Amiga emulation). When the video is synchronized, you get perfect scrolling in games without the micro-stuttering which will otherwise occur. FS-UAE can synchronize with your display on all supported operating systems.<\/p>\n<h2>Great Scaling and Video Options<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE uses OpenGL for video output, and there are many options to tweak how the Amiga display is shown on your screen. By default, the Amiga display stretches to fill your monitor, but you can enable aspect correction, zoom in or out, enable OpenGL shaders for advanced effects, and use visual themes.<\/p>\n<h2>Open Amiga Game Database<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE Launcher integrates with the Open Amiga Game Database (OAGD). This allows FS-UAE to scan your Amiga game files and automatically create game entries for recognized ADF, IPF and WHDLoad games. The games will be automatically configured, and FS-UAE Launcher will also download covers and screenshots from OAGD.net.<\/p>\n<h2>Emulate High-End Amigas<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE supports emulating an Amiga 4000 with an CPU as fast as your system can emulate it. Picasso96 drivers can be used with the built-in UAEgfx card to display Workbench in high resolutions and with up to 16.7 million colors, and the built-in bsdsocket.library means that the Amiga will have access to the Internet.<\/p>\n<h2>Available for Multiple Operating Systems<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Apart from a few small differences, the feature set is the same on all platforms.<\/p>\n<h2>Cross-Platform Online Play<\/h2>\n<p>A unique feature is support for <a title=\"FS-UAE Online Play\" href=\"\/online-play\">cross-platform online play<\/a>. You can now play Amiga games against (or with) friends over the Internet. The online play feature is designed in a way which avoids de-synchronization issues.<\/p>\n<h2>Available in Multiple Languages<\/h2>\n<p>Both FS-UAE and FS-UAE Launcher are translated into several languages. The currently supported languages are French, German, Italian, Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l), Polish, and Serbian. -In addition to English, which is the default language.<\/p>\n<h2>Flexible Screenshot Support<\/h2>\n<p>When you take a screenshot in FS-UAE, by default you get three different images saved to your screenshots folder. One is the real screenshot (the scaled graphics you see on screen), but FS-UAE also saves a 1:1 pixel image of the entire Amiga video output, and also an 1:1 image which is cropped to what you see on screen.<\/p>\n<h2>Built-In Support for WHDLoad<\/h2>\n<p>If you have archived WHDLoad games in .zip or .lha, you can launch many of them by simply adding the archive as a hard drive. FS-UAE Launcher will recognize that it is a WHDLoad game, and automatically configure an &#8220;internal hard drive&#8221; to boot and launch the game for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Open Source<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE is free software and is licensed under GPLv2 (other parts \/ dependendent libraries are licensed under LGPL or other open source licenses). Source code is available on the download page, and parts of the FS-UAE project (including the emulator itself) have public git repositories.<\/p>\n<h2>Online Documentation<\/h2>\n<p>A great deal of documentation about how to use and configure FS-UAE is available on fs-uae.net.<\/p>\n<h2>Community Support<\/h2>\n<p>There is a support forum for FS-UAE on the English Amiga Board with many active registered users. If you are stuck, you&#8217;ll almost certainly get an answer to your questions there. You can also leave comments on fs-uae.net is you rather want that.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>FS-UAE is an Amiga emulator for Windows, Linux and Mac OS Xbased on UAE\/WinUAE, with a focus on emulating games, though it also emulates high-end Amigas.

The net play server can be download from the <a title=\"Download FS-UAE\" href=\"\/download\">download page<\/a> (If you are using the development series of FS-UAE, you should download the server from the <a title=\"Download FS-UAE Beta\" href=\"\/download-devel\">development series download page<\/a> instead).<\/p>\n<p>Support forum thread is here:\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/eab.abime.net\/showthread.php?t=63289\">http:\/\/eab.abime.net\/showthread.php?t=63289<\/a><\/p>\n<p class=\"info\">You might want to use the <a title=\"Launcher Net Play\" href=\"\/launcher-net-play\">net play support in FS-UAE Launcher<\/a> to initiate the net play session instead of doing it manually.<\/p>\n<h2>Synchronization<\/h2>\n<p>The emulation is designed to never get out of sync across clients, but in case it does, it will be detected by the server immediately, because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A checksum of the Amiga memory contents is sent to the server for every frame (chip, slow and fast mem).<\/li>\n<li>Random number generator synchronization is checked for every frame.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These measures do not prevent desync in any way, but are designed to detect desyncs even before humans would notice. It is there important to run with exactly the same setup on all clients:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kickstart must be identical. If not, the server will detect that memory contents differ on startup and abort the game.<\/li>\n<li>The amiga model, accuracy setting and amount of memory etc must be identical.<\/li>\n<li>Same number of floppy drives, and exactly the same floppy images inserted into the drives (please use checksums to verify that they are the same). Remember that floppy overlay files override original disk content!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Example: If two players are trying to play Pinball Dreams, the game might boot just fine up right until the main menu, and you get a desync there. If this happens, it is because (different) highscores were stored on disk 2, and the Amiga just read the highscores into memory. I&#8217;ll say it again: <strong>use the (exact) same disks!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There can of course exist bugs which allow desyncs to happen. Please report issues to the support forum, but first ensure that your setup is identical.<\/p>\n<h2>Important notes<\/h2>\n<p><strong>You should use net play with floppy based games for now.<\/strong> Hard drive support in net play is not tested, and there are probably synchronization issues due to threads being use for hard drive emulation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Remember to make sure setup is identical!<\/strong> An important thing to remember is that FS-UAE stored floppy overlay files. If there exists floppy overlay files for a specific ADF\/IPF file, this file must exist and be identical for each client.<\/p>\n<h2>Synchronized floppy swapping<\/h2>\n<p>You can swap floppies in the floppy drives during net play. If one player changes floppy, the same change will be done simultaneously for all players.<\/p>\n<p>The floppy images themselves are not transferred across the network, so it is important that all players have the same floppy image list.\u00a0The paths themselves do not need to the identicial, but floppy_image_1 must point to a disk file with identical checksum for all players. Same for all other floppy image list entries.<\/p>\n<h2>Synchronized state saving and restoring<\/h2>\n<p>You can use state saving and restoring during net play. There are several use cases for save states which must be discussed separately:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Saving a state during game play to restore later during the same session<\/strong>. When saving a state while in net play, every player will then get a compatible save state in the given save state slot, so when later during the same session, restoring the same state should work without issues.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Restoring a state which was saved in an earlier play session.<\/strong>\u00a0If the state was saved with the same players present, everyone should have a compatible save state in the same slot (unless overwritten), and restoring the state should work.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Restoring a state which is not shared by all players.<\/strong>\u00a0This one is a bit more difficult. It should be possible to manually copy one or more save states from one player to the others, and then restore this state during net play. However, some paths are stored in the state file (floppy image paths, etc). This should work if the paths used for floppies (etc) are the same for all players. This can be achieved by using (identical) relative paths in your configuration or (identical) paths with $-prefixes (or even absolute paths if the files are stored in the exactly same location for all players).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Lag and smooth play<\/h2>\n<p>FS-UAE should work pretty well in this regard, by now. But playing on a wireless network is <strong>not<\/strong> recommended. It will work, but if there is some packet loss, the emulation will jitter, and the input lag will increase for this player.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to keep packet loss to a minimum. For technical reasons, network communication <strong>must<\/strong>\u00a0be ordered and guaranteed, so TCP is used and not UDP. When packet loss occurs, TCP will incur delays which will impact the performance of the player with lag. Other players will not be affected unless the delays are extreme. Here are some tips:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid wireless networks. Packet loss will degrade smoothness and increase input lag. Even more important: avoid running the <strong>server<\/strong> on a wireless link. This can degrade performance for all clients.<\/li>\n<li>Do not saturate the Internet link with data. Pause (or limit) torrents etc. FS-UAE itself does not use much bandwitch, but a satured link will have packet loss.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To minimize input lag, FS-UAE will control \/ alter the frame rate based on information from the server. This means that full video sync is not compatible and will automatically be disabled.<\/p>\n<h2>User interface and Chat<\/h2>\n<p>While using net play beta, can can press the Tab key to write a text message for other players to see. Also, a HUD will appear displaying the player tags of all connected players\u00a0along with emulation lag (in ms) and ping time to server (in ms &#8211; round trip trime) for each player.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Server setup<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One player must start the server, either locally, or on another computer.\u00a0The server requires Python (&gt;= 2.6) to be installed. It is now compatible with Python 3. To start the server with the defaults (2 players, port 25000), run:<\/p>\n<pre>python fs-uae-game-server-1.2.0.py<\/pre>\n<p>To start the server with other settings, you can run:<\/p>\n<pre>python fs-uae-game-server-1.2.0.py --port=9876 --players=3<\/pre>\n<p>The server will then wait until all players are connected until proceeding. When a client is connected, it will wait to start the game until all clients are ready and it gets a go from the\u00a0server.<\/p>\n<p>The server address\/port must be directly connectable by all clients, so modify firewall \/ router setup as needed.<\/p>\n<h2>Client setup<\/h2>\n<p>There is no graphical user interface to launch net play (yet anyway).\u00a0To connect to a server, you must use the following options (either from config, or command line).<\/p>\n<pre>netplay_server = ip adress or host name<\/pre>\n<p>The following options can be specified, but are not required:<\/p>\n<p>Use custom port instead of 9999:<\/p>\n<pre>netplay_port = 9876<\/pre>\n<p>Use a custom tag (&#8220;nick name&#8221;) while playing. Will show up in the HUD:<\/p>\n<pre>netplay_tag = ABC<\/pre>\n<p>If the server is started with a password, you must specify the same password for the clients:<\/p>\n<pre>netplay_password = password<\/pre>\n<p>Keyboard input is shared by all players. Permissions for input is a feature that could be implemented later, but for now, you&#8217;ll have to trust your opponents to play fair. Generally, all input is shared, so it is possible for two players to control the same &#8220;joystick&#8221;. One player could use directional control, and the other could control the fire button.<\/p>\n<p>When using joysticks, yoy most likely want to have opposite setups, for example. one player would have<\/p>\n<pre>joystick_port_0_mode = joystick\r\njoystick_port_1_mode = joystick\r\njoystick_port_0 = name of player 1's joystick\r\njoystick_port_1 = nothing<\/pre>\n<p>While the second player would have<\/p>\n<pre>joystick_port_0_mode = joystick\r\njoystick_port_1_mode = joystick\r\njoystick_port_0 = nothing\r\njoystick_port_1 = name of player 2's joystick<\/pre>\n<p>It is important that the Amiga thinks the same devices are connected, so all players should have the same values for joystick_port_0_mode and joystick_port_1_mode (these settings will be synchronized anyway, but with different settings, it can be a bit random which one &#8220;wins&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>If you want to play two-player lemmings with one mouse each, you should have the following configs:<\/p>\n<pre>joystick_port_0_mode = mouse\r\njoystick_port_1_mode = mouse\r\njoystick_port_0 = mouse\r\njoystick_port_1 = nothing<\/pre>\n<p>and<\/p>\n<pre>joystick_port_0_mode = mouse\r\njoystick_port_1_mode = mouse\r\njoystick_port_0 = nothing\r\njoystick_port_1 = mouse<\/pre>\n<p>Here is a command-line example to start net play:<\/p>\n<pre>fs-uae lotus2.fs-uae --netplay-server=192.168.1.5 --netplay-tag=ABC<\/pre>\n<h2>Issues which may occur<\/h2>\n<p>If an unrecoverable error occurs, the server will stop, and all clients (FS-UAE) will continue running the emulation in offline mode.
