<p>Translations were missing from FS-UAE Launcher on Windows and Linux, so I&#8217;ve <a href="https://fs-uae.net/download">posted new versions</a> with translations included</p>



<p>Also, due to changes in SDL2, some controllers (Xbox controllers at least) have new IDs and the bundled controller mappings no longer match. So you need to remap your controller in Launcher settings if you cannot utilize all buttons anymore. I&#8217;ll see if I can get new controller configs included in an update!</p>

<p>The following links point to the latest stable version compiled for macOS_ARM64. These are 3.1.x versions based on slightly newer code than the 3.0.5 version.</p>



<p><a href="https://fs-uae.net/files/FS-UAE-Launcher/Stable/Latest/FS-UAE-Launcher_Stable_macOS_ARM64.dmg">FS-UAE-Launcher_Stable_macOS_ARM64.dmg</a><br><a href="https://fs-uae.net/files/FS-UAE/Stable/Latest/FS-UAE_Stable_macOS_ARM64.dmg">FS-UAE_Stable_macOS_ARM64.dmg</a></p>



<p>Compared to previous downloads, FS-UAE Launcher.app no longer contains an embedded FS-UAE.app. Therefore, you need to download both of the .dmg files above and place FS-UAE Launcher.app and FS-UAE.app beside eachother, for example in the /Applications folder. I haven&#8217;t had time to fix builds of FS-UAE Arcade yet.</p>



<p>There are also macOS_ARM64 builds available for the 4.x development snapshots. If interested, please see <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=106562">this forum thread</a> for links and more information.</p>

<p>I do get some questions asking for an FS-UAE version running natively on Apple silicon / M1. The short answer is that it is possible to build a working version for M1, but I don&#8217;t yet provide official builds due to not having access to the hardware. Please see this recent thread on the English Amiga Board for more information: <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=106970">https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=106970</a>.</p>



<p>There has also been reports about joystick/gamepad devices not working on M1 hardware with FS-UAE 3.0.5. I have created newer builds &#8211; available here for now: <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=105950">https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=105950</a> &#8211; which are reported to fix the issue <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>EDIT: Official ARM64 builds for Apple silicon / M1 are coming.<br></p>

<p>Warren Vercueil has written a nice and thorough guide on getting FS-UAE on Linux set up with real MIDI hardware. The guide was written to use Bars and Pipes with MIDI hardware, but should work with other Amiga MIDI software as well.</p>



<div class="wp-block-file"><a href="https://fs-uae.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FS_UAE_Ubuntu_BnP_Tutorial.pdf">FS_UAE_Ubuntu_BnP_Tutorial.pdf</a><a href="https://fs-uae.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/FS_UAE_Ubuntu_BnP_Tutorial.pdf" class="wp-block-file__button" download>Download</a></div>



<p>Disclaimer: I haven&#8217;t tested the guide myself.</p>



<p>Note: If all you want to do is to play back MIDI tunes, for example to use FS-UAE to play Sierra games with MT-32 music (using an MT-32 emulator on your host computer), you should wait until FS-UAE 3.9.x arrives, which should support this use case on all platforms via the portmidi library.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have created a new binary distribution for <a href="/download-devel#steamos">Linux / SteamOS</a>. These packages are very new, and should be considered experimental.</p>
<p>The naming is a bit misleading, the requirement isn&#8217;t really SteamOS, but rather the Steam Runtime! This means that this version should run on any Linux distribution where Steam (or Steam Runtime) is installed. Please report if the packages are not working on your Linux distro <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>This package can be particular useful if FS-UAE packages are not available for your Linux distro (or if only older versions are available). The SteamOS version will also probably be used as the base for a new Linux portable distribution (similar to the Windows and OS X portable versions).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Windows version is now built using the excellent <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/msys2/">MSYS2</a> distribution. This distributions contains updated version of all requirements for FS-UAE and (almost) all requirements for FS-UAE Launcher &#038; Arcade, including a Python version compiled with mingw. The end result is a build environment which is much easier to set up and use. I even made an easy-to-follow <a href="/compiling-on-windows">step by step tutorial</a> for installing this environment and compiling the git version of FS-UAE on Windows. But, there is always a chance that the changes have introduced bugs in FS-UAE or FS-UAE Launcher, so please let me know if something which worked in 2.5.20dev is broken in 2.5.21dev.</p>
<p>The OS X build environment has also been updated with newer library versions &#8211; so same here, please report any new issues in 2.5.21.dev, if any.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 a while ago, and were curious to see how well FS-UAE runs on the current version of Unity (the default desktop in Ubuntu). Unfortunately, it does not run that well by default (same as 12.10).</p>
<p>The problem is really only in windowed mode. FS-UAE syncs to vblank by default, and in combination with the Unity compositing / indirect rendering, the performance is bad, with laggy / choppy rendering (1). When using video_sync = off, the performance is &#8220;normal&#8221;. On the bright side, full-screen performance seems to be improved when syncing to vblank. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope Ubuntu / Canonical manage to fix the OpenGL support with Mir (though I would rather see them joining forces with Wayland). For the time being, I&#8217;m using the MATE desktop on Ubuntu. Without any compositing / desktop effects, OpenGL performance is nice, and FS-UAE frame rates are as smooth as can be (2) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>(1) With official closed-source Nvidia drivers.<br />
(2) With monitor running @50Hz of course.</p>
<p>FS-UAE for Ubuntu 13.04 is <a href="http://fs-uae.net/download">available from a PPA</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 (with upgraded nVIDIA drivers), I have no longer been able to use <strong>1920&#215;1080 @ 50 Hz</strong>. I can run <code>xrandr -r 50</code> without errors -and the screen turns off/on again, but the screen is still running at 60 Hz afterwards (and xrandr itself confirms this). I could of course (probably) have downgraded the drivers, but I didn&#8217;t..</p>
<p>I have however just now found a workaround, I can successfully switch to my defined 50 Hz mode with the nvidia-settings program, like this:<code></code></p>
<pre>nvidia-settings -a CurrentMetaMode=1920x1080_50_0</pre>
<p>And to switch back to 60 Hz:<code></code></p>
<pre>nvidia-settings -a CurrentMetaMode=1920x1080_60_0</pre>
<p>This requires that valid modelines are defined with the names <code>1920x1080_50_0</code> and <code>1920x1080_60_0</code>. See <a title="50Hz Display Modes on Linux with nVIDIA Drivers" href="/50hz-display-modes-on-linux-with-nvidia-drivers">50Hz Display Modes on Linux with nVIDIA Drivers</a> fore more information.</p>
<p>My original problem is also reported by someone else:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When trying to change refresh rate the screen goes blank for a second as it usually does but rate is not changed. Both xrandr and nvidia-settings show the old refresh rate still.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The report got the following response:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thanks for reporting this. I can confirm that, at least on my system, the &#8211;rate option seems to be ineffective on a recent 304 driver. I&#8217;ve filed NVIDIA bug 1054623. Feel free to use this bug number in future inquiries about this issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>FS-UAE Launcher currently supports using a game database to automatically find games you have by scanning your directories for known disk images and/or WHDLoad games, but it is currently a bit difficult for people to contribute to this database -this needs to be much easier!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=66335">You should vote here</a> if you would like to see this feature developed further -or if you think this is a waste of time!<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Current features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan a list of directories and look for known files</li>
<li>Â Found games are automatically added to the game list in the launcher.</li>
<li>Show cover, title and screenshots for known games.</li>
<li>Floppy-based games in ADF and IPF format are supported</li>
<li>Files are identified and found by checksum, not name, so you organize your files as you see fit, and don&#8217;t need to constantly rename files according to DAT files or similar.</li>
<li>WHDLoad games are supported -WHDLoad games can be zipped or unzipped, the launcher can find the individual files on disk (or in archives) and re-assemble the WHDLoad game on launch.</li>
<li>Files inside zip archives are also indexes, and are temporarily extracted on demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thousands of game entries have been automatically created by an algorithm looking at (among other sources) the TOSEC dat files to get a starting point. But of course, not all these configurations work out of the box. Special configuration may be needed. So to get a quality database, humans must test and improve the entries.</p>
<p>I propose a system where the launcher automatically synchronizes game entries from a central server, and where anyone can make modifications to game entries in the FS-UAE Launcher GUI, register an account on the server, and have FS-UAE Launcher submit the fixes to the central server so everyone will benefit from the improvements. This includes specifying custom configuration (if needed) and submitting images.</p>
<ul>
<li>The central server will keep history for all changes, so changes can be easily reverted.</li>
<li>The list of changes will be used to download incremental updates to the database.</li>
<li>It will be possible to have local overrides for specific configuration values and/or images.</li>
<li>Images can be downloaded on demand (and cached), so the launcher does not need to download a huge data set to get started.</li>
<li>This is mainly a configuration database, and it is not intenteded to compete with Hall Of Light or Lemon Amiga for collecting detailed metadata. A minimal set of metadata (year, publisher, etc) is of course relevant, but for extended information, links til HOL/LemonAmiga will be associated with entries.</li>
</ul>
<p>The database includes many variations of the same games (for instance multiple cracked versions from the TOSEC set). I propose some kind of voting/rating/like system, so only the most popular variants are showed in the launcher by default if you have many variants available (configurable by the user, of course).</p>
<p>The license for the database should be a quite liberal license (a Creative Commons variant?) to allow other projects to use the information as well. It does not make sense (IMO) to build such a database and then try to limit the usability.</p>
<p>It only makes sense to build infrastructure for this if people are interested in contributing.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=66335">You should vote</a> if you would like to see this feature developed</strong> (and also perhaps subscribe to the thread if you want to follow the discussion)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fs-uae/">public git repository</a> was recently updated to reflect my own development environment better. Version numbers are now <strong>not</strong> updated in all places on version number bump, only the VERSION file is updated. Run &#8220;make dist&#8221; to get a new sub-dir with clean source and version numbers correctly updated in all files, or you can use windows.mk, macosx.mk, debian.mk etc to build releases. Building the workspace with &#8220;make&#8221; works just fine, but the version number is then fixed as &#8220;9.8.7&#8221;.</p>
<p>This repo update is also related to the fact that the official releases are from now on automatically built from the repo on google code (branch &#8220;release-devel&#8221;) using build slaves connected to a jenkins instance.</p>
<p>Please note that the repository URLs on opensuse build service will change (for a proper split between stable / devel releases once 2.0 is out). New repository base for the development releases is: <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/FrodeSolheim:/devel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">http://download.opensuse.org/reposit&#8230;/fs-uae-devel/</a>. Similarly, if some of you track directory content; devel releases on fengestad.no will be put in <a href="/devel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://fengestad.no/fs-uae/devel/</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m also experimenting with PPA builds for Ubuntu: development version PPA is available at <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Efengestad/+archive/devel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://launchpad.net/~fengestad/+archive/devel</a> (not all amd64 packages are done building yet).</p>
<p>All this just means that I can spent a little less time pushing out releases and more time coding. Also, occasionally forgetting to push the source code or publish update for a given platform should not be a problem any more <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am now planning a new stable release. There is too much good stuff in 1.3.x which is not available in 1.2.x &#8211; especially the launcher, since this is very useful for casual setup and especially for beginners. The reason I&#8217;m thinking of bumping the version number to 2.0 instead of 1.4 is because I feel the inclusion of the launcher represents a great leap in functionality (for those interested).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m quite happy with the state of FS-UAE itself for 2.0, but I think the launcher needs some more work and polish before it should be heavily promoted to newcomers to FS-UAE.</p>
<p>I have assembled a list of stuff I think should be done before 2.0 can be released. I would very much like feedback if you know something of else which should be fixed or implemented first.</p>
<p><span id="more-1267"></span></p>
<p>Please remember that you shouldn&#8217;t just suggest all favorite wish-list items (development will continue on the 2.1.x branch). Instead, try to think if there is some important function missing which could put off new users when they try out FS-UAE 2.0 for the first time (esp. with the Launcher since I assume I will direct new users towards it).</p>

<li>New official option to enable RTG video card (&#8220;uaegfx_card&#8221;)</li>
<li>(Perhaps) new official option to enable JIT where available (&#8220;jit_compiler&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
<h2>FS-UAE Launcher</h2>
<ul>
<li>Automatically scan/check kickstarts on startup (no &#8220;Scan&#8221; needed).</li>
<li>Automatically scan/check .fs-uae configurations. (from Documents/FS-UAE/Configurations) on startup.</li>
<li>Saving configurations.</li>
<li>When saving configuration, save with portable paths (if possible) if the Launcher is run in portable mode.</li>
<li>Support specifying the number of floppy drives.</li>
<li>Floppy drive volume setting.</li>
<li>Floppy drive speed override.</li>
<li>Automatically add images in drives to swap list (if not already present).</li>
<li>GUI for Memory options.</li>
<li>GUI to enable RTG graphics, bsdsocket.library (and perhaps JIT).</li>
<li>GUI for video sync mode and method settings.</li>
<li>Replace configuration list view with a new custom list view (the current one has buggy rendering on some platforms).</li>
<li>Temporarily remove (unused) favorite button.</li>
<li>Temporarily remove (unused) verified button.</li>
<li>Remove net play tab, but perhaps include checkbox in settings to enable (&#8220;Enable experimental support for net play&#8221;) -since the net play GUI is not 100% newbie friendly yet.</li>
<li>Support selecting &#8220;Preferred&#8221; or &#8220;Primary&#8221; / &#8220;Secondary&#8221; joysticks in joystick port selectors, especially useful when saving configuration so the joystick device name is not hardcoded into the config file.</li>
<li>Implement support for upgrading the scan database (when the schema is updated) instead of creating a new empty database.</li>
<li>New icon for the launcher to make it visually distinct from FS-UAE.</li>
<li>(Perhaps) FS-UAE Launcher can download and use updated AROS roms on demand.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deferred to 2.1.x or later:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Merge updated WinUAE code.</li>
<li>Enable CD-ROM eject function.</li>
<li>(Launcher) Improved game database support.</li>
<li>&#8230; and other new features.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>I would also like to improve the documentation, especially with some tutorials to help newcomers use and discover features of FS-UAE (and Amiga emulation in general). Of course the getting started-guide must be updated with a launcher guide, and other documentation must be reviewed to make sure the information is correct for 2.0.</p>
<p>New Topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual Hard Drives &#8211; explaining how mounted folders work, with some details concerning the implementation.</li>
<li>Networking Support</li>
<li>Enabling RTG Graphics (Picasso96) &#8211; How to enable it, link to tutorial for installing drives, and explain a bit how to configure it for best performance.</li>
<li>Adding covers and screenshots to the Launcher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggested Tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing Amiga Forever Files (ROMs and the AF HD setup).</li>
<li>Installing Workbench 3.11 (on a Virtual HD).</li>
<li>Installing the Picasso96 Driver.</li>
<li>Installing ClassicWB / AmigaSYS / AmiKit in FS-UAE.</li>
<li>Installing the 1080X Ambermoon Bezel Theme.</li>
<li>Using Shaders for Special Effects.</li>
<li>Using WHDLoad Games with a High-end Amiga Setup.</li>
<li>Creating a Portable Cross-platform FS-UAE Installation (put FS-UAE, Launcher, Games / Amiga HDs on a portable device and run stuff from there)</li>
<li>Creating Self-contained App Bundles for OS X.</li>
</ul>
