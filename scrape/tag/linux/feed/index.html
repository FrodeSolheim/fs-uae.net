										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 a while ago, and were curious to see how well FS-UAE runs on the current version of Unity (the default desktop in Ubuntu). Unfortunately, it does not run that well by default (same as 12.10).</p>
<p>The problem is really only in windowed mode. FS-UAE syncs to vblank by default, and in combination with the Unity compositing / indirect rendering, the performance is bad, with laggy / choppy rendering (1). When using video_sync = off, the performance is &#8220;normal&#8221;. On the bright side, full-screen performance seems to be improved when syncing to vblank. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope Ubuntu / Canonical manage to fix the OpenGL support with Mir (though I would rather see them joining forces with Wayland). For the time being, I&#8217;m using the MATE desktop on Ubuntu. Without any compositing / desktop effects, OpenGL performance is nice, and FS-UAE frame rates are as smooth as can be (2) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>(1) With official closed-source Nvidia drivers.<br />
(2) With monitor running @50Hz of course.</p>
<p>FS-UAE for Ubuntu 13.04 is <a href="http://fs-uae.net/download">available from a PPA</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 (with upgraded nVIDIA drivers), I have no longer been able to use <strong>1920&#215;1080 @ 50 Hz</strong>. I can run <code>xrandr -r 50</code> without errors -and the screen turns off/on again, but the screen is still running at 60 Hz afterwards (and xrandr itself confirms this). I could of course (probably) have downgraded the drivers, but I didn&#8217;t..</p>
<p>I have however just now found a workaround, I can successfully switch to my defined 50 Hz mode with the nvidia-settings program, like this:<code></code></p>
<pre>nvidia-settings -a CurrentMetaMode=1920x1080_50_0</pre>
<p>And to switch back to 60 Hz:<code></code></p>
<pre>nvidia-settings -a CurrentMetaMode=1920x1080_60_0</pre>
<p>This requires that valid modelines are defined with the names <code>1920x1080_50_0</code> and <code>1920x1080_60_0</code>. See <a title="50Hz Display Modes on Linux with nVIDIA Drivers" href="/50hz-display-modes-on-linux-with-nvidia-drivers">50Hz Display Modes on Linux with nVIDIA Drivers</a> fore more information.</p>
<p>My original problem is also reported by someone else:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When trying to change refresh rate the screen goes blank for a second as it usually does but rate is not changed. Both xrandr and nvidia-settings show the old refresh rate still.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The report got the following response:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thanks for reporting this. I can confirm that, at least on my system, the &#8211;rate option seems to be ineffective on a recent 304 driver. I&#8217;ve filed NVIDIA bug 1054623. Feel free to use this bug number in future inquiries about this issue.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fs-uae/">public git repository</a> was recently updated to reflect my own development environment better. Version numbers are now <strong>not</strong> updated in all places on version number bump, only the VERSION file is updated. Run &#8220;make dist&#8221; to get a new sub-dir with clean source and version numbers correctly updated in all files, or you can use windows.mk, macosx.mk, debian.mk etc to build releases. Building the workspace with &#8220;make&#8221; works just fine, but the version number is then fixed as &#8220;9.8.7&#8221;.</p>
<p>This repo update is also related to the fact that the official releases are from now on automatically built from the repo on google code (branch &#8220;release-devel&#8221;) using build slaves connected to a jenkins instance.</p>
<p>Please note that the repository URLs on opensuse build service will change (for a proper split between stable / devel releases once 2.0 is out). New repository base for the development releases is: <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/FrodeSolheim:/devel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="broken_link">http://download.opensuse.org/reposit&#8230;/fs-uae-devel/</a>. Similarly, if some of you track directory content; devel releases on fengestad.no will be put in <a href="/devel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://fengestad.no/fs-uae/devel/</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m also experimenting with PPA builds for Ubuntu: development version PPA is available at <a href="https://launchpad.net/%7Efengestad/+archive/devel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://launchpad.net/~fengestad/+archive/devel</a> (not all amd64 packages are done building yet).</p>
<p>All this just means that I can spent a little less time pushing out releases and more time coding. Also, occasionally forgetting to push the source code or publish update for a given platform should not be a problem any more <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
