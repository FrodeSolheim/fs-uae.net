		<p>FS-UAE supports online play by synchronizing the emulators for all players in a game. The mechanism is designed in a way which ensures that the emulators will not get out of sync if used correctly.</p>
<p>The net play feature has been tested by players from several countries and works well ðŸ™‚</p>
<h2>FS-UAE Launcher Net Play</h2>
<p>The launcher enhances online play by integrating chat room functionality into the launcher itself. Options are synchronized for all players by the launcher automatically, ensuring that the game is set up correctly before it starts.</p>
<p class="info">The net play GUI needs to be activated in the launcher first.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that, while it works well, it will be a lot more user friendly with a more extensive GUI. Currently, you need to type a couple of commands to get it running &#8211; this can scare off some users, which is why you explicitly need to enable it for now. Read the <a title="Launcher Net Play" href="/launcher-net-play">guide for Launcher net play</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>FS-UAE Net Play</h2>
<p>You can use FS-UAE in net play mode directly without using the launcher. But in this case, you must ensure that all players have compatible config before the game is started. Read the <a title="FS-UAE Net Play" href="/net-play">documentation page for FS-UAE net play</a> for more information.</p>
