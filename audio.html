		<p>These options do not affect the Amiga emulation itself, but will affect how the Amiga audio is played back. Altering these options affect the quality and/or latency of the audio output.</p>
<p>Relevant options: <a href="/options#audio_buffer_target_bytes">audio_buffer_target_bytes</a></p>
<h2>Audio Buffer Management</h2>
<p>FS-UAE uses dynamic buffer management to try and keep the average fill of the audio buffer at a certain point. It indirectly controls the buffer fill by slightly tweaking the playback frequency if the buffer fill grows or shrinks. The playback frequency is determined by a PID controller, so the system is somewhat similar to the way a thermostat or the cruise control of a car works.</p>
<p>The controller is configured so that the changes to the frequency are very small &#8211; and the buffer is corrected over time &#8211; so you should (hopefully) not be able to hear this. Currently, the PID controller values are hardcoded and can not be configured.</p>
<h2>OpenAL Driver Settings</h2>
<p>FS-UAE uses OpenAL to output audio. In most cases, the actual OpenAL implementation is <a href="https://openal-soft.org/">OpenAL Soft</a>, and you can tweak the behavior of the audio driver with an <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/openal-soft.git/blob/HEAD:/alsoftrc.sample">OpenAL configuration file</a>. OpenAL can support several audio backends depending on your system.</p>
<p>By creating ~/.alsoftrc, you can configure which audio backend and device OpenAL uses for audio ouput, along with several other options. For example, you can tweak FS-UAE&#8217;s internal audio buffering with <a href="/options#audio_buffer_target_bytes">audio_buffer_target_bytes</a>, but you need to configure OpenAL separately if you want to tweak its internal buffers.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/openal-soft.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/alsoftrc.sample">alsoftrc.sample</a> for documentation.</p>
