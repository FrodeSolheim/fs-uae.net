<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>
  We respect your privacy. Therefore, we do not use any tracking cookies and do not try to track
  you. No content is automatically loaded from third-party servers while browsing this site, so
  third parties will not be able to track you either. Traffic to and from this site is encrypted,
  but your Internet service provider and the hosting provider will still be able to see that
  encrypted traffic passes from your IP address and the website.
</p>
<p>
  IP addresses are stored in server access logs for a limited amount of time, along with the URLs
  accessed from that IP address and the date/time of access. This information is stored in order to
  aid with investigations into performance issues and abuse, but only used if necessary. The list of
  URLs accessed may be used to see what parts of the site are being used.
</p>
<p>
  No information is handed over to third parties, but information may be given to government
  officials if required by law or to aid in criminal investigations. This has never happened, and I
  will update this privacy policy if this should ever occur.
</p>
<p>This privacy policy applies to <a href="https://fs-uae.net">fs-uae.net</a>.</p>
