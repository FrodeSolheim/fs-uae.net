<p>
  Translations were missing from FS-UAE Launcher on Windows and Linux, so I&#8217;ve
  <a href="/download/">posted new versions</a> with translations included
</p>
<p>
  Also, due to changes in SDL2, some controllers (Xbox controllers at least) have new IDs and the
  bundled controller mappings no longer match. So you need to remap your controller in Launcher
  settings if you cannot utilize all buttons anymore. I&#8217;ll see if I can get new controller
  configs included in an update!
