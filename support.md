# Support

The primary support channel is the
<a href="http://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=122">support.FS-UAE</a> sub-forum over at the
English Amiga Board and answer questions there regularly. Also, updates on current development
are posted there. An advantage of posting in
<a href="http://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=122">support.FS-UAE</a> is that other people
may be able to help you as well, and maintaining a longer discussion (if necessary) is easier.

If you have any kind of issue with FS-UAE, you are welcome to create a new thread and explain
your problem. It is also useful if you attach
<a href="/logs">fs-uae.log.txt</a> to your post when the problem
is related to running FS-UAE.

## Discord chat

Use the [Discord server invite link](/discord) if you want to disuss FS-UAE or follow progress more closely.

## E-mail

You can reach me on e-mail
<a class="email" href="mailto:frode@fs-uae.net">frode@fs-uae.net</a>, but I prefer that
requests for support and similar go to the support forum for several reasons:

- Other people familiar with the topic can help you as well, lessening the support burden for me.
- The question and subsequent replies will be available for other people in the future.
- Some questions may involve Amiga specifics I'm not familiar with. Many knowledgable people read and post on the English Amiga Board.
