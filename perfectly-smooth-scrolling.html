            In order to get perfect scrolling in (PAL) Amiga games, your display
            <strong>must</strong> run with a <strong>refresh rate of 50Hz</strong> (*) and you must
            have video synchronization enabled in FS-UAE.
          </p>
          <p>
            Video synchronization will automatically be enabled if FS-UAE detects that your display
            runs at 50Hz and you have enabled video sync in preferences. In case it doesn&#8217;t
            detect it, you can force full video sync with the <em>video_sync</em> option. If you
            force this, and the display isn&#8217;t running at 50Hz, the emulation will instead run
            at incorrect speed and you will get issues with sound.
          </p>
          <p>(*) When running NTSC Amiga emulation, your display must be running at 60Hz.</p>
          <h2>Enabling 50Hz Modes</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on your system and display, this can be either easy or difficult to get 50Hz
            modes working. If you have have a 1920&#215;1080 monitor which announces it&#8217;s
            support for 50hz properly, it can be as easy as just switching the refresh rate with the
            control panel on your system.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other cases you may be able to create a custom 50Hz mode for your monitor. For Linux,
            you can tweak modelines in Xorg.conf, and for Mac OS X, you can use a tool such as
            <a href="http://www.madrau.com/download/latest/latest.html">SwitchResX</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Windows users may be able to use a program called Powerstrip to create a 50Hz mode for
            the monitor &#8211; if a 50Hz mode is not already available.
          </p>
          <h2>50Hz Modes in Linux with nVIDIA</h2>
          <p>
            With LCDs and nVIDIA drivers, getting a working 50Hz mode can be a bit difficult in some
            cases, so I have written a how-to on
