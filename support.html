    <p style="margin-top: 0px;">I am moderating the <a
            href="http://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=122">support.FS-UAE</a>
        forum over at the English Amiga Board and answer questions there
        regularly. Also, updates on current development are posted there. An
        advantage of posting in <a
            href="http://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=122">support.FS-UAE</a>
        is that other people may be able to help you as well, and maintaining a
        longer discussion (if necessary) is easier.</p>
    <p>If you have any kind of issue with FS-UAE, you are welcome to create a
        new thread and explain your problem. It is also useful if you attach
        <a href="/logs"><samp class="filename">fs-uae.log.txt</samp></a> to your
        post when the problem is related to running FS-UAE.

    <h2>E-mail</h2>
    <p>You can reach me on e-mail <a class="email"
            href="mailto:frode@fs-uae.net">frode@fs-uae.net</a>, but I prefer
        that requests for support and similar go to the support forum for two
        reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Other people familiar with the topic can help you as well, lessening
            the support burden for me.</li>
        <li>The question and subsequent replies will be available for other
            people in the future.</li>
    </ul>

<p>If you don't want to register on the English Amiga Board, you can leave a
    comment on this website instead. The advantage of posting in <a
        href="http://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=122">support.FS-UAE</a> is
    that other people may be able to help you as well, and maintaining a longer
    discussion (if necessary) is easier.</p>
<p>For <strong>live support</strong>, you can connect to the IRC support channel
    directly from your web browser: <a
        href="http://embed.mibbit.com/?server=irc.abime.net:6667&amp;channel=%23FS-UAE">Enter
        live support channel</a>. The most likely time to get help is during the
    evening (UTC+1), but there may be people around to help at other times as
    well.</p>
<p>General feedback, praise or constructive criticism is always welcome, both
    here and in the forum :)</p>
