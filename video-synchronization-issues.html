		<p>Configuring FS-UAE to run the emulation in sync with the display is required to enable perfect scrolling in games. However, in some cases, your desktop environment may interfere with FS-UAE&#8217;s ability to do this, and you may end up with worse performance instead of better.</p>
<h2>Desktop Compositor</h2>
<p>When you have a desktop environment with a compositor running, you may run into one or more of the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video frame rate is not completely smooth even when full emulation-display synchronization is enabled.</li>
<li>In some cases (observed with Unity on nVIDIA), the frame rate is about halved.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have one of these problems, you can try one of the following workarounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running FS-UAE in fullscreen may help or completely fix the problem.</li>
<li>Temporarily disable compositing (for example in KDE).</li>
<li>Temporarily use another window manager / desktop environment.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use video synchronization (but then you won&#8217;t get perfect scrolling in games either).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ubuntu With 3D Acceleration</h2>
<p>Video synchronization @50Hz does not seem to work properly in Window mode with Compiz/Unity and compositing / 3D acceleration enabled, at least not with the proprietary nVIDIA drivers. Run FS-UAE in fullscreen to get smooth scrolling with 50Hz modes.</p>
<p>You may also need to do the following: Install <em>CompizConfig Settings Manager</em>, open it, click on <em>General/Composite</em>, and make sure <em>Unredirect Fullscreen Windows</em> is ticked.</p>
<h2>Display Synchronization Options</h2>
<p>You may get more stable video synchronization by trying out the different values for the <a title="Video Options" href="/video-options"><em>video_sync_method</em></a> option.</p>
