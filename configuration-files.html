              Most FS-UAE settings are controlled via configuration files. The available options are
              listed in the <a title="Configuration" href="/options">configuration options</a> page.
              Also see <a title="Paths and Directories" href="/paths">paths and directories</a> for
              more relevant information.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
              You can use <a href="/launcher" title="FS-UAE Launcher">FS-UAE Launcher</a>, a
              user-friendly graphical interface instead of writing configuration files manually.
            </p>
            <h2>Default Configuration File</h2>
            <p>
              The following configuration fileÂ  will be automatically loaded unless the program is
              started with another configuration file (for instance by &#8220;opening&#8221; a
              configuration file in FS-UAE):
            </p>
            <pre>Documents/FS-UAE/Configurations/Default.fs-uae</pre>
            <p>
              On Windows, make sure it isn&#8217;t really called Default.fs-uae.txt. It is easy to
              be fooled since Windows Explorer hides the file extension by default.
            </p>
            <h2>Specifying Paths in Configuration Files</h2>
            <p>Paths in configuration files can be specified as either:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Relative paths</li>
              <li>Absolute paths</li>
              <li>Paths beginning with special variables</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="info">
              On Windows, you must either use forward slashes in paths in configuration files, or
              you must use double backslashes. Example: C:/Amiga/Files and C:\\Amiga\\Files are both
              correct, but C:\Amiga\Files is not!
            </p>
            <p>
              Relative paths will be looked up relative to either the current directory, or most
              often relative to a relevant default directory. For example, relative floppy image
              paths will be looked up relative to the Floppies directory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Absolute paths are paths beginning with a drive letter (Windows), or a slash (Linux,
              Mac OS X, FreeBSD).
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid having to use absolute paths, and to make configuration files more portable,
              you can prefix paths with some special variables (Note: these are not environment
              variables, though $HOME looks like one):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>$CONFIG &#8211; The directory containing the loaded configuration file.</li>
              <li>
                $EXE &#8211; The directory containing the currently running FS-UAE executable.
              </li>
              <li>
                $APP &#8211; On Mac OS X, the directory containing the currently running FS-UAE.app,
                on other platforms, it is he same as $EXE.
              </li>
              <li>$HOME &#8211; The user&#8217;s home directory.</li>
              <li>$DOCUMENTS &#8211; The user&#8217;s documents directory.</li>
              <li>$BASE &#8211; The FS-UAE base directory, usually Documents/FS-UAE.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Custom Configuration File</h2>
            <p>
              To load a custom configuration instead of the default, just give the path to the
              configuration file as a program argument, Example for Windows:
            </p>
            <pre>fs-uae.exe D:/example/CustomConfig.fs-uae</pre>
            <p>For other platforms, something like:</p>
            <pre>fs-uae /example/CustomConfig.fs-uae</pre>
            <p>This also means that you can (in most desktop environments):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Associate .fs-uae files with the FS-UAE application, so FS-UAE starts with the
                configuration if you open the .fs-uae file.
              </li>
              <li>Drag and drop .fs-uae configuration files to the FS-UAE application icon.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>FS-UAE Launcher and Configuration Files</h2>
            <p>
              FS-UAE Launcher will list all configuration files found in
              Documents/FS-UAE/Configurations in a convenient list view.
            </p>
            <h2>Relative Configuration File</h2>
            <p>
              If you are creating a portable FS-UAE setup, you will want FS-UAE to automatically
              find the correct configuration file even if the program is moved around. Before
              looking for Default.fs-uae, FS-UAE will look for the following file in the directory
              containing the executable:
            </p>
            <pre>Config.fs-uae</pre>
            <p>
              So for instance, if you had the windows version of FS-UAE installed in
              E:\Software\FS-UAE, and the executable is E:\Software\FS-UAE\FS-UAE.exe, it will then
              try to first find:
            </p>
            <pre>E:\Software\FS-UAE\Config.fs-uae</pre>
            <p>Inside that configuration file, you can also prefix paths with:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>$CONFIG/ (the directory containing the configuration file), or</li>
              <li>$EXE/ (the directory contaning the executable)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In this specific case, these should be the same. For example, you could use the
              <a href="/options#base_dir">base_dir</a> option to have FS-UAE create its default
              directories in this same directory:
            </p>
            <pre>base_dir = $CONFIG/</pre>
            <p>And FS-UAE will then use/create the following directories (and more):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>E:\Software\FS-UAE\Floppies</li>
              <li>E:\Software\FS-UAE\Kickstarts</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Hidden Default Configuration File</h2>
            <p>
              FS-UAE automatically creates a number of sub-folders in Documents/FS-UAE on startup.
              If you wish to avoid this behavior, you can use the
              <a href="/options#base_dir">base_dir</a> option to specify an alternative directory.
              But obviously, it does not make any sense to specify this in
              Documents/FS-UAE/Configurations/Default.fs-uae.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the following configuration file is found, it will be used as the default
              configuration file instead of Default.fs-uae:
            </p>
            <pre>$HOME/.config/fs-uae/fs-uae.conf</pre>
            <p>
              And by specifying the <a href="/options#base_dir">base_dir</a> option there, you can
              have FS-UAE create the default directories somewhere else.
            </p>
            <h2>Host Options File</h2>
            <p>
              The file Host.fs-uae is always read in addition to Default.fs-uae (or the specific
              configuration file used when launching FS-UAE). Common settings such as fullscreen and
              scanlines can be set here. Options in Host.fs-uae will be applied first, so you can
              override the defaults set here in the primary configuration file.
            </p>
            <p class="info">When using FS-UAE Launcher, the Host.fs-uae file is ignored.</p>
