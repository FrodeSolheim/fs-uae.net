    <h1>Log files</h1>
    <p>The location of the log files (<samp
            class="filename">fs-uae.log.txt</samp>
        and
        <samp class="filename">fs-uae-launcher.log.txt</samp>)
        can vary slightly:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The log files are generally found in <samp class="dirname">(My)
                Documents/FS-UAE/Cache/Logs</samp>.</li>
        <li>If you are using the portable version, they'll be in
            <samp class="dirname">Cache/Logs</samp>
            within the portable directory.
        </li>
        <li>On Linux, might also find them in
            <samp class="dirname">~/FS-UAE/Cache/Logs</samp> if <samp
                class="envvar">XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR</samp> is
            not
            set.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Including log files when reporting an issue</h2>
    <p>When reporting issues with FS-UAE or FS-UAE Launcher, you may be asked
        to provide log files to help debugging the problem (or
        clear up any misunderstandings). Some important things to consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Before attaching the log files, you <strong>must quit</strong>
            FS-UAE and/or FS-UAE Launcher. If not, the log files may be
            incomplete.</li>
        <li>The log files are recreated each time you start the program. So
            when
            reporting a problem, you must ensure that you experienced the
            problem on
            the last run of the program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you're reporting a problem on the <a class="external"
            href="https://eab.abime.net/forumdisplay.php?f=122">English Amiga
            Board
            forum</a>, it's easy to include the log files. When writing a reply
        to
        creating a thread, you can attach the log files to the post.</p>
    <p>If you
        are asked to send log files by e-mail,
        please send to <a class="email"
            href="mailto:frode@fs-uae.net">frode@fs-uae.net</a>.</p>
