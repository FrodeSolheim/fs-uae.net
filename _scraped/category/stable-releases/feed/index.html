<p>The repositories are all hosted by the openSUSE Build Service. Previously, I&#8217;ve also pushed out builds via Ubuntu&#8217;s PPA service, but I will most likely not continue doing this since it is easier for me do to distribute everything via this single service.</p>

<p>I have made a <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=108745">post over at the English Amiga Board</a> with links to FS-UAE &amp; Launcher version 3.1. I recommend that most users using 3.0.5 upgrade to this version. I haven&#8217;t updated the downloads section here yet, among other things because there isn&#8217;t an installer available yet. But it&#8217;s still easy to <a href="https://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=108745">download and install version 3.1</a>.</p>



<p>It is especially recommended for macOS users to upgrade, as this latest version fixes some annoying issues on recent macOS versions.</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://fs-uae.net/download">stable version</a> has been released. Changes in FS-UAE 3.0.1:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Fix video scaling when restoring from fullscreen on Windows.</li></ul>



<p>Changes in FS-UAE Launcher 3.0.1:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Scanner bug prevented Conquests of the Longbow WHDLoad to be recognized.</li><li>The correct kickstart wasn&#8217;t always loaded.</li><li>Cloanto ROMs were not always decrypted.</li><li>Fix for global WHDLoad quit key.</li></ul>



<p>I have some issues getting the app to work without warning on macOS 10.15 due to the new security/notarization features on macOS, and absence of useful error messages when stuff don&#8217;t work. You can right click and choose open to bypass the strict security checks until I&#8217;ve worked this out. <strong>[EDIT: Looks like it is fixed now -> 3.0.1u1]</strong></p>

<p>Changes in FS-UAE 3.0 (compared to 2.8):<br><br> * Fixed JIT direct access on modern Linux distributions.<br> * FS-UAE default is now to show a 692&#215;540 image, not stretched to fill screen.<br> * Built-in configurations for many more game controllers.<br> * New option whdload_quit_key to gracefully quit slaves.<br> * Added more shaders (compiled/ported/written by guest.r and rsn8887).<br> * Updated emulation core from WinUAE 3300b2.<br> * Several new configuration options (see Changelog for details).<br> * Many more smaller fixes and updates (see Changelog for details).<br><br> Changes in FS-UAE Launcher 3.0 (compared to 2.8):<br><br> * Plugins can provide files for offline use (WHDLoad, JST, SKick, etc).<br> * Added support for .gz/.adz/.roz/.xz-compressed files.<br> * Support WHDLoad versions 18.4 and 18.5 (game database).<br> * Revert fullscreen_mode to default when upgrading from older versions.<br> * Use https for all more fs-uae.net and openretro.org communication.<br> * Support hd_requirements = xpkmaster.library.<br> * Fixed problem on Windows where devices were sometimes not detected.<br> * Make configurations list wider when window width is quite large.<br> * Try to use config from game database when launching with a WHDLoad archive.<br> * Extract WHDLoad arguments from .info file when loading a WHDLoad archive.<br> * Sync &#8220;unpublished&#8221; games from the online game database, option to show.<br> * Many bugfixes and smaller improvements (see Changelog for details).<br><br> Build-related:<br><br> * Only x86-64 (64-bit) official builds for Windows and macOS and Linux.<br> * Building for x86 (32-bit) still works on all platforms.<br> * 32-bit packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora and openSUSE are still available.<br> * Builds for macOS require 10.9+. The source can be built for older versions.<br><br> (Bottom line, no support is removed from the source code. I just want to maintain less build environments).<br><br> Road ahead:<br><br> I&#8217;ve already started the work on next development series. The biggest  change is updated emulation core from WinUAE 4.2.1, which brings with it  new features. But I will be looking at other improvements as well. If  the stable series is to boring for you, stay tuned for v3.1.0dev <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bugfix release (2.4.3) has been issued for the stable series of FS-UAE. This version fixes a bug which causes a crash in FS-UAE on Linux with recent official NVIDIA drivers. Windows and OS X users do not need to update (and I will not provide updated builds for those platforms either). Source code is available here: <a href="/stable/2.4.3/">http://fs-uae.net/stable/2.4.3/</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to NVIDIA which actually tracked down the bug in FS-UAE! The problem was an unused function (mprotected), a legacy from older WinUAE code, which was exported and caused the NVIDIA drivers to load this function instead of the correct one from libc. I&#8217;m quite impressed that they contacted me with information about the bug, and I think this shows how serious they are about their Linux drivers <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The latest development versions are not affected by this problem (the function has already been removed, and also, symbols are no longer exported by default).</p>
