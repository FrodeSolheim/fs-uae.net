		<p>Depending on your monitor, 50Hz display modes can be a bit difficult to get working. Here are some tips based on my own experiences.</p>
<p>Not all steps are necessary to perform on all systems. If the display announces it&#8217;s support for 50hz modes properly, many of these steps are uneccessary. Mentioned configuration values applies to xorg.conf.</p>
<p>FS-UAE will automatically enable full video sync when it detects (through xrandr) that your display is running @50Hz. This does not always work on Linux with nVIDIA (official) drivers.</p>
<p>The display may actually run at 60Hz even if you have created a custom 50hz modeline and switched to that mode. To check the actual refresh rate, run this in a terminal:</p>
<pre>export __GL_SYNC_TO_VBLANK=1
glxgears</pre>
<p>glxgears will then (after a few seconds) print the actual refresh rate to the console.</p>
<p>Problem 1: nVIDIA drivers lie about refresh rates when &#8220;Dynamic Twin View&#8221; is enabled. You will then typically see refresh rates (when running the xrandr command) beginning at 50, then always increasing by 1 (51, 52, 53, 54, &#8230;). If you want correct refresh rates here, you must disable dynamic twin view:</p>
<pre>Option "DynamicTwinView" "False"</pre>
<p>Problem 2: Even with DynamicTwinView disabled, xrandr can still report a refresh rate of 50hz while it is in reality is 60Hz (This is related to the nVIDIA driver&#8217;s concept of frontend and backend resolution).</p>
<p>The following options will tell the nVIDIA driver to allow 50Hz backend modes in some cases where it would otherwise map your frontend custom modelines to a 60hz backend resolution:</p>
<pre>Option "ExactModeTimingsDVI" "True"
Option "ModeValidation" "AllowNon60HzDFPModes"</pre>
<p>This option can also help, at least if you are creating modes with are not using the display&#8217;s native resolution:</p>
<pre>Option "FlatPanelProperties" "Scaling=Native"</pre>
<p>Lastly, you may have a problem where your custom 50Hz modelines are just ignored by the drivers, even though you know your display can run at 50Hz at a specific</p>
<p>resolution. One reason for this is that display EDID information contains limits for vertical refresh, which are often wrong. For instance, my own monitor will happily display 1920&#215;1080@50hz, but the EDID information says that the minimum vertical refresh is 56Hz, which causes the nVIDIA drivers to ignore the modeline.</p>
<p>You can luckily override this:</p>
<pre>Option "UseEdidFreqs" "False"
HorizSync 30-83
VertRefresh 46-76</pre>
<p>If you have problems getting your modeline to be recognized, this option will help by logging at lot of information regarding modeline validation to Xorg.0.log.</p>
<pre>Option "ModeDebug" "True"</pre>
<p>Here is a complete example provided for reference (my own xorg.conf file actually):</p>
<pre>Section "Monitor"
  Identifier "Default Monitor"
  Option "UseEdidFreqs" "False"
  Option "ExactModeTimingsDVI" "True"
  ModeLine "1920x1080_50_0" 148.50 1920 2448 2492 2640 1080 1084 1089 1125 +HSync +VSync
