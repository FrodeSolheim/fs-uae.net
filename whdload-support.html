		<p>FS-UAE Launcher has special support for running individually zipped (or compressed with LHA) WHDLoad Games. It will even store save-games in the state directory.</p>
<h2>Alternative Ways to use WHDLoad</h2>
<p>This page contains details about how the WHDLoad feature is manually enabled, there are two other ways to use WHDLoad games in FS-UAE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the online game database <strong>(recommended)</strong>, this will give you <strong>automatic support</strong> for running WHDLoad games, no configuration needed.</li>
<li>Create an Amiga Workbench environment on an emulated hard drive and install the WHDLoad package and games manually.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enabling the WHDLoad Feature</h2>
<p>This feature is enabled by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inserting a zip/lha file containing a WHDLoad game as the primary hard drive.</li>
<li>Write the name of the slave in the <em>WHDLoad Arguments</em> text box, optionally along with slave options.</li>
<li>Just write the full name of the slave only, do not include the directory name.</li>
</ul>
<p class="warning">You should currently <strong>not</strong> use save states when you use this feature. The temporary creation of hard drives will confuse the save state system</p>
<p>Example <em>WHDLoad Arguments</em>:</p>
<pre>Lotus2.slave</pre>
<p>The following automatically happens when <em>WHDLoad arguments</em> is specified and you start the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contents of the zip/lha file is unpacked to a temporary folder, which is what is really used as the primary hard drive in FS-UAE.</li>
<li>WHDLoad is downloaded (if not already downloaded) and merged into the temporary drive.</li>
<li>Kickstart images are copied into the temporary drive -needed for several WHDLoad slaves.</li>
<li>If any modified files (from an earlier launch) are found in the state dir, these are copied/merged into the temporary drive.</li>
<li>The slave is located and a startup-sequence file is created to boot the WHDLoad game.</li>
<li>The contents of the temporary drive is analyzed and checksummed, so any modified files can be saved to the state dir when FS-UAE is done running.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a more advanced example of <em>WHDLoad Arguments</em>, showing how to specify slave options:</p>
<pre>Lotus2.slave PRELOAD BUTTONWAIT CUSTOM1=1 CUSTOM2=1</pre>
<h2>Details Regarding the Temporary Drive</h2>
<p class="info">You don&#8217;t need to read the following information unless you are interested in the exact details on how the WHDLoad support is implemented.</p>
<p>First of all, the zip/lha file containing the game is unpack to the temporary drive, and then a routine is performed to transform this into a bootable system. At the time of writing, the following files are downloaded and copied into the drive:</p>
<pre>Devs/Kickstarts/kick40068.A1200.RTB
Devs/Kickstarts/kick34005.A500.RTB
Devs/Kickstarts/kick40068.A4000.RTB
C/WHDLoad
</pre>
<p>The following kickstart files are copied from your kickstart directory if they are available (matched by checksum, not names):</p>
<pre>Devs/Kickstarts/kick34005.A500
Devs/Kickstarts/kick40068.A1200
Devs/Kickstarts/kick40068.A4000</pre>
<p>The following file is populated with some default values:</p>
<pre>S/WHDLoad.prefs</pre>
<p>The registration key (if found) is copied to:</p>
<pre>S/WHDLoad.key</pre>
<p>SetPatch from Workbench 3.0 is copied, provided that a Workbench 3.0 disk is indexed by the file database function:</p>
<pre>C/SetPatch</pre>
<p>Finally, the startup sequence is written to:</p>
<pre>S/startup-sequence</pre>
<p>The startup sequence consists of starting WHDLoad with the slave, followed by running <em>uae-configuration SPC_QUIT 1</em> to quit the emulation when the slave is done running.</p>
<h2>Registered WHDLoad</h2>
<p>If Documents/FS-UAE/WHDLoad.key is found, it will be copied toÂ <em>DH0:S/WHDLoad.key</em> when preparing the temporary hard drive. This only applies to people having purchased WHDLoad before the full version became free, and who wants to use the registered version.</p>
